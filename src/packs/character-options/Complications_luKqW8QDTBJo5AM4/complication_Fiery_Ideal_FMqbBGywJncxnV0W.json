      "value": "<p>A spirit beyond your comprehension chose you to be the guardian of a place, a cause, or another ideal. A flame burns in your soul, one that can burn your enemies - or yourself, if you fall short of your ideal.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you are fighting on behalf of your ideal, when you score a tier 3 success with a damage-dealing ability, you deal additional fire damage equal to your highest characteristic score.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you act against your ideal or fail to live up to the high standards associated with your ideal, you take 5 + your level fire damage. This damage canâ€™t be decreased in any way.</p>",
