In any case, a sinister cult has decided that you’re very important to their plan - though you don’t particularly like the fate they have in mind for you.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have three Destiny Points. You can spend a Destiny Point in place of a heroic resource of your class. Each time you gain a Victory, you regain one Destiny Point.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you spend a Destiny Point, you take 1d10 psychic damage and the cult that seeks you becomes aware of your location.</p>",
