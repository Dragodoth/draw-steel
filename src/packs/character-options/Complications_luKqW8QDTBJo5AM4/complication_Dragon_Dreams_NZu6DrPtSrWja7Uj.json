You haven’t told anyone about the dreams, except for your one strange relative who seems to know more than they’re letting on.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose two ancestry points worth of dragon knight traits. Whenever you have at least 5 Victories, you gain those traits.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you are reduced to 0 Stamina, you explode with heat and fire. You and each creature within 5 squares of you takes fire damage equal to twice your level. You can’t reduce this damage for yourself in any way.</p>",
