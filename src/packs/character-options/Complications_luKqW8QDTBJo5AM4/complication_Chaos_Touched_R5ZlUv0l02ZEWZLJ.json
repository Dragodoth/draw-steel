Now you can sprout and retract limbs in a way that can horrify unprepared onlookers.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain an edge on power rolls that are part of the Grab, Escape a Grab, or Knockback maneuver. Additionally, you can hold an extra item even when your hands are full.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> While dying, you grow and retract uncoordinated limbs, making all power rolls with a bane.</p>",
