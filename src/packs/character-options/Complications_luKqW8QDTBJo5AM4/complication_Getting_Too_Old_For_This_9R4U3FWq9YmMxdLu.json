      "value": "<p>You used to be a renowned hero, but you’ve been living the last few years in blissful peace. Now you’re coming out of retirement for one last hurrah. Your fighting skills have atrophied to the point where you’re no stronger than a wet-behind-the-ears starting adventurer, but you still remember some of your old tricks.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> On your turn, choose a heroic ability that you would be able to learn if you were one level higher. Provided you meet the ability’s other prerequisites and you can spend the required heroic resources, you can use this ability. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you have gained 2 Victories.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> While you are winded, your speed is reduced by 2.</p>",
