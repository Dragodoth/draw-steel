      "value": "<p>You’re one step ahead of a pursuer - perhaps a bounty hunter determined to bring you to justice, a revenant, or an assassin intent on your death. Someday, you’ll be strong enough to face your pursuer head to head, but for now you’re living your life on the run.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When other creatures are pursuing you, you can take the lay low respite activity. When you use it, anyone pursuing you loses track of your party’s location and must start their search again.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Each time you gain Renown, your pursuer learns your location. Unless you lay low or move to a new location, within a 1d10 days you’ll be visited by the pursuer’s minions, or, if you linger, the pursuer.</p>",
