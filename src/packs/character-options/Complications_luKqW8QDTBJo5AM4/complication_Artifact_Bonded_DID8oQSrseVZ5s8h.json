      "value": "<p>A powerful artifact has bonded to you. You might be destined to wield the artifact or to destroy it. You’re not powerful enough to use it at the moment, although you may one day be. For now, the item has no effect beyond getting you in trouble.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The first time in an encounter that you are reduced to 0 Stamina against your will, the artifact appears on your person and then disappears at the end of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When the artifact disappears from your grasp, you lose a Recovery. If you have no Recoveries remaining, you take 1d10 damage instead, which can’t be reduced in any way.</p>",
