You are now infused with the power of that elemental - and they’re not happy about it.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you are dying, your possessing elemental takes control of your body. The elemental yearns for destruction, causing you to attack the closest creature they notice without regard for your desires or your body’s safety.
