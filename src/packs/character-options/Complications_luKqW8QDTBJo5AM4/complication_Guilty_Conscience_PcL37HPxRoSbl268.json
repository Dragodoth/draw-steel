      "value": "<p>The world is in trouble - and it’s partly your fault. Maybe you helped a villain rise to power or inadvertently released a demon from imprisonment. Now it’s your mission to repair the damage you caused.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You’re determined to stay alive so you can set things right. When you are reduced to the negative of your winded value, you can spend a Recovery as a free triggered action.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Many people blame you for the evils you caused. They may be unfriendly or hostile to you - and you can see their point of view. You have a bane on tests made to interact with or strike those who accuse you of the sin you have committed.</p>",
