      "value": "<p>Your mentor taught you everything, and you trusted them implicitly - until they went rogue, betraying you or your organization. Their current whereabouts and activities are unknown, although there are disturbing rumors - and you, as their former pupil, are under suspicion as well.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your mentor taught you the Corrupt Spirit maneuver, which, in retrospect, should have aroused your suspicion.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You have holy weakness 1. Each time you use Corrupt Spirit, your holy weakness increases by 1, to a maximum of your Recovery value. This weakness is reset to 1 after you take holy damage.</p>",
