Your soul is forfeit unless you find a loophole or convince the devil to void the deal.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your body bears a fiendish mark. Anyone who understands religion can tell that your soul belongs to Hell, giving you a bane on tests made to interact with them (unless they’re into that). Additionally, when you die, your soul goes to Hell and you can’t be restored to life.</p>",
