      "value": "<p>You somehow obtained the notebook of a brilliant but eccentric member of your class. It should help you unlock powerful new abilities - if you can ever figure out what it means.</p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> As a respite activity, you can study the notebook. Make a test using your highest characteristic. On an 11 or lower, you summon a hostile demon of your level or lower who attacks you at the end of the respite. The demon gets to act first in the combat, no matter any other creatureâ€™s traits or abilities. On a 16 or less, you learn nothing and your time is wasted. On a 17+, you learn a bonus heroic ability from your class that you qualify for. You only know the ability until you finish a respite.</p>",
