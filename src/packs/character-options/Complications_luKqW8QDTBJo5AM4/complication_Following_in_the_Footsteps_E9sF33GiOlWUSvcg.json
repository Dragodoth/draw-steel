Youâ€™ve studied their legends, and someday you hope to learn their most famous battle technique.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a heroic ability for your class that requires a higher level than your current one. When you learn this ability, it costs 2 heroic resources less than usual (minimum 1).</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> In your quest for advanced techniques, you have neglected basics. Choose a heroic ability that you already know. It costs 1 heroic resource more than usual.</p>",
