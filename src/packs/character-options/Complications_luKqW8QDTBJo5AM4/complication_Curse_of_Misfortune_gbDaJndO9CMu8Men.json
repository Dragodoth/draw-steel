Now, in moments of pressure that require great skill, you have a tendency to choke, falling and flailing in such a dramatic fashion that you take everyone with you.</p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> When you make a test in combat and get a consequence, you and every ally within 1 falls prone, causing you to barely miss any further consequence.</p>",
