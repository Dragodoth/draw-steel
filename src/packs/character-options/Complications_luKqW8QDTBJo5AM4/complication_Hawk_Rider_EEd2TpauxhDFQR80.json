      "value": "<p>You travel with a giant hawk that you stole from the Hawklords. Perhaps you were once a Hawklord yourself, or perhaps you escaped their captivity. Traveling with a giant hawk comes with its share of inconveniences and dangers, but they’re a small price to pay for the sky.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While outside, you can spend a minute to summon your giant hawk, which acts as your mount. You can dismiss the hawk as a free action. The hawk won’t go inside, and it won’t accept anyone but you as a rider. If the hawk takes damage or dies, you can restore it to full Stamina as a respite activity.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> People who know of your crime are afraid to interact with you, since they worry the Hawklords will come after them by association. You have a bane on tests made to influence anyone who knows of the Hawklords and who has seen you with your giant hawk. Such people might report you to the Hawklords, who can come looking for you.</p>",
