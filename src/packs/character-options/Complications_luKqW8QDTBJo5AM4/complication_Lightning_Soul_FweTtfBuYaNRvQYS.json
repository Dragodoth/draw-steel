      "value": "<p>You were caught in a storm and stuck by lightning - but you survived. Something saved you. Maybe it was a gods-given miracle, a latent psionic gift, or the magic of a helpful elementalist, but you absorbed the lightning into your body. Itâ€™s always there, simmering under the surface.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you regain Stamina in combat, you gain a surge. Whenever you spend a surge, you can make the extra damage it deals lightning damage.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you are wet, you have damage weakness 5.</p>",
