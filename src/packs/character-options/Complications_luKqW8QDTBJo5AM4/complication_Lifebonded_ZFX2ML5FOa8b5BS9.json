An enemy?</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose another creature that doesn’t have the Lifebonded complication. When you die, your body disappears until that creature completes a respite or gains one Victory. You then appear next to the creature, fully healed.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> If the creature you’re bound to dies, you die as well, no matter what other traits or features you have.</p>",
