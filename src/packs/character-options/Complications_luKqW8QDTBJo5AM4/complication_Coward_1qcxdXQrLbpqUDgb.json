      "value": "<p>Some call you a coward, just because you shriek and run when you encounter danger. Sure, you might not have the natural bravado of less-imaginative people, and sure, you’re always imagining the many horrible ways you could die, but you’re used to fear. When you run in terror, you run towards the enemy.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can move toward the source of your fear while you are frightened.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you make a saving throw to end the frightened condition, you roll 2d10 and take the lowest result.</p>",
