      "value": "<p>A deal went south, or you got involved with the wrong people, and now you owe a debt or a ransom - the kind that would bankrupt a minor noble. In order to pay it off, you’ll need to take some dangerous risks.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You’re good with money - you’ve had to be. Whenever you would gain Wealth, you gain 1 more than what you’d normally earn.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your starting Wealth is -5. While your Wealth is less than 1, you can purchase items as if you had 1 Wealth, but you’re frequently visited by threatening creditors, and shopkeepers tend to lock their doors when they see you coming.</p>",
