      "value": "<p>Sure, you’re a promising young hero in your own right - but people always ask you about your famous relative. Will you equal or surpass your relative’s accomplishments, or will you always live in their shadow?</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> \nYou have a piece of magic jewelry, such as a signet ring. As a maneuver, you can use the item to summon your relative to your aid. Your relative does their best to help you out of the current perilous situation, and disappears after 1 hour or after the perilous situation is resolved. Once you summon your relative, you can’t do so again until you gain a level.\n\nYour relative has the same statistics as you do except for Renown, doesn’t gain the benefit of any of your treasures, and makes all power rolls with an edge. Your relative starts with a Renown of 10.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> After you summon your relative, the next time you gain Renown your relative gains the Renown instead and you gain no Victories from any combat encounters or other Victory-earning challenges for which they were present.</p>",
