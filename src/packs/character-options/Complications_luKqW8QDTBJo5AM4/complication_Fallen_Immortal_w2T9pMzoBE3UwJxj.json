Now, as a punishment or perhaps as a reward, you have put aside your wings and become a mortal. Your remaining years will be short, but living aside your fellow mortals gives your life new meaning.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you deal untyped damage, you can deal holy damage instead.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You will never fully gain a mortalâ€™s comfort with untruth. When you make a test to deceive another creature, you do so with a bane.</p>",
